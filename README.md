# **README - HTML and SCSS Prototype Reproduction**

This project is a reproduction of a design prototype based on a PNG file, created as part of a training program at becodes.org. The goal of this exercise is to practice HTML and SCSS (Sass) by converting a visual design into a functional web layout.

# Project Structure

## The project consists of the following files and directories:

    -index.html: The main HTML file that represents the structure of the web page.
    -styles.scss: The main SCSS file where the styling rules are defined.
    -css/: A directory containing the compiled CSS file (styles.css) generated from the SCSS code.
    -assets/: A directory to store any necessary images used in the design.

# Getting Started

To view and work with the project locally, follow these steps:

    1.Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project files.
    2.Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
    3.Install any necessary dependencies or plugins required for compiling SCSS (if not already installed).
    4.Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the rendered web page.
